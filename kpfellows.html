      <p class="question-header">What impact do you want to have on the world and why?</p>
      <p class="question-response">I want to impact the world by helping people pursue their passions and goals,
        whether that be by helping them design beautiful logos and websites, launch startups,
        manage their mental health, create social media content, meet potential collaborators,
        or find communities of people with similar interests. I’m extremely passionate about
        giving people the tools to pursue their dreams or create side projects because, from
        my own experience, I have found that people are at their best when they are doing what
        they love to do with people who also share their interests. For me, that has come from
        helping others, of all skill levels, pursue their dreams, empowering students to create
        music, art, YouTube channels and more through Cornell Creatives, an organization that I
        co-founded.</p>
      <p class="question-response">In order to get to the reality where people can work on what they are most passionate
        about, I believe that there are a number of opportunity areas that technology can and
        has already addressed. For instance, Figma has democratized design, allowing people of
        all abilities to collaborate with others and easily create graphics, user interfaces,
        and even building layouts, and Karat and Brex are helping creators and startups, respectively,
        finance their goals. Despite that, I still believe that there are a number of areas in
        the passion economy, from producing films to improving productivity to to getting more
        detailed community analytics that could still be disrupted and democratized.</p>

  <div class="container-fluid" class="question">
    <div class="question-content" href="#meaning">
      <p class="question-header">Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you.</p>
      <p class="question-response">My most meaningful experiences have come from my side projects like Cornell
        Creatives,
        an initiative that I co-launched to empower students to pursue their creative passions,
        and from my experiences at hackathons, where I have been able to meet new people,
        learn new technologies, and build to solve problems.</p>
      <p class="question-response">Cornell Creatives has been an especially meaningful experience for me because it
        was the first project that I was able to scale, reaching 1.8k students on our social
        media and connecting almost 500 students in our community, and take ownership of,
        leading a team of 23 to identify and address problems that students face in pursuing
        their creative passions. Through Cornell Creatives, I have also had the flexibility
        to launch initiatives like developing resources and featured projects pages for
        our website and visualizing our community’s creative output (i.e. the number
        of albums made, films produced, etc.) to inspire people to create.</p>
      <p class="question-response">Hackathons, on the other hand, are meaningful to me because they provide me with
        opportunities to meet other hackers and learn new technologies. For instance, at
        my most recent hackathon, I built a Discord bot with a team of 4 people, 2 of which
        I had never met before, and had my first experiences working with MongoDB and
        TypeScript. To that end, I am driven by experiences in which I can take ownership,
        meet new people, learn new things, and build.</p>
